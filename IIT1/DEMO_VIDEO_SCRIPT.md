### **ENTITY RESOLUTION DEMO (0:30 - 1:30)**
**[Navigate to Entities Page]**

**Narrator:** "Let's start with our core entity resolution capability. Here we see real campus personnel loaded from our student and staff profiles."

**[Show entities loading dynamically]**
- Neha Mehta (CIVIL Student)
- Ishaan Desai (Admin Student) 
- Priya Malhotra (CIVIL Faculty)

**[Click "View" on Neha Mehta]**

**Narrator:** "When I click View, our system demonstrates multi-modal fusion. Notice how we've linked Neha across multiple data sources:"
- Entity ID: E100000
- Card ID: C3286
- Face ID: F100000 (using InceptionResnetV1 embeddings)
- Device Hash: DH6d0bd80c8f8e

**[Show timeline in modal]**
**Narrator:** "Our timeline reconstruction shows Neha's activities across card swipes, CCTV detections, and WiFi connections - all automatically correlated."

---

### **CROSS-SOURCE LINKING (1:30 - 2:15)**
**[Navigate to Analytics Page]**

**Narrator:** "Our analytics page demonstrates cross-source linking performance. We've successfully established 15,847 connections across our 9 data sources."

**[Show data source cards]**
**Narrator:** "Each data source contributes to our entity resolution:"
- Card Swipes: 2,847 records
- CCTV Frames: 1,923 face detections using InceptionResnetV1
- WiFi Logs: 5,384 active sessions
- Library checkouts, lab bookings, and help desk tickets

**[Show system health bars]**
**Narrator:** "Our system maintains 94.7% entity resolution accuracy and 87.2% data processing efficiency."

---

### **SECURITY & PREDICTIVE MONITORING (2:15 - 3:00)**
**[Navigate to Security Page]**

**Narrator:** "Now let's examine our predictive monitoring and security features. Our ML inference system has generated 1,247 predictions today with 91.3% accuracy."

**[Show security alerts]**
**Narrator:** "Here's a real security alert: unusual activity detected - multiple failed card swipe attempts at LAB_301. Our system automatically correlates this with entity E104001."

**[Show predictive insights panel]**
**Narrator:** "Our predictive insights identify risk hotspots. LAB_301 shows medium risk, ADMIN_BLOCK shows high risk based on historical patterns. The ML confidence indicator shows 91% prediction accuracy."

**[Click "Investigate" button]**
**Narrator:** "Security personnel can immediately investigate alerts with full context and recommended actions."

---

### **REAL-TIME MONITORING (3:00 - 3:45)**
**[Navigate to Monitoring Page]**

**Narrator:** "Our monitoring system provides real-time campus oversight. All 12 CCTV cameras are online with live face detection using our InceptionResnetV1 embeddings."

**[Show live activity feed]**
**Narrator:** "The activity feed shows real-time events: card swipes, WiFi connections, CCTV detections, and lab bookings - all correlated to specific entities and locations."

**[Show location heatmap]**
**Narrator:** "Our location heatmap provides instant visibility into campus activity levels, helping security teams prioritize their attention."

---

### **SAMPLE QUERIES & TIMELINE (3:45 - 4:30)**
**[Go back to Entities page, use search]**

**Narrator:** "Let me demonstrate our query capabilities. I'll search for 'Neha Mehta'..."

**[Type in search box, show results]**
**[Click View on search result]**

**Narrator:** "Our system instantly retrieves her complete profile and generates a comprehensive timeline. Notice how we've reconstructed her daily activities:"
- 9:15 AM: Card swipe at LAB_101
- 9:17 AM: WiFi connection to AP_LAB_201  
- 11:30 AM: CCTV detection at LIBRARY
- 2:45 PM: Lab booking confirmation

**Narrator:** "This timeline generation combines structured data, text analysis, and face recognition - demonstrating true multi-modal fusion."

---

### **TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (4:30 - 4:50)**
**[Show Settings page briefly]**

**Narrator:** "Our system handles privacy and security with configurable data retention, encryption at rest, and anonymization options. We maintain audit logs and role-based access control."

**[Navigate back to Dashboard]**

**Narrator:** "The dashboard provides administrators with comprehensive oversight - from individual entity tracking to campus-wide security metrics."

---

### **CLOSING (4:50 - 5:00)**
**[Final dashboard view]**

**Narrator:** "Our Campus Entity Resolution & Security Monitoring System successfully demonstrates all five core objectives: entity resolution, cross-source linking, multi-modal fusion, timeline generation, and predictive monitoring. The system processes real campus data with 94.7% accuracy while maintaining privacy and security standards."

**[Show final metrics]**
- 7,293 entities tracked
- 9 data sources integrated  
- 15,847 cross-source links established
- Real-time security monitoring

**Narrator:** "Thank you for watching our demo. Our system is ready for deployment and scalable for any campus environment."
