# Saptang Labs - Campus Entity Resolution & Security Monitoring System

## 🎯 Challenge Overview
**Goal**: Build a Cross-Source Entity Resolution System with Security UI that unifies campus data sources for comprehensive activity tracking and security monitoring.

## 📊 Dataset Analysis
**9 Interconnected Data Sources** (Total: ~2.1GB):
1. **Campus Card Swipes** (278KB) - Physical access logs with location tracking
2. **CCTV Frames** (275KB) - Video surveillance data with face detection  
3. **Face Embeddings** (78MB) - ML-ready face recognition vectors (7K records)
4. **Face Images** (1.5GB zip) - Actual face image files
5. **Student/Staff Profiles** (621KB) - User directory with roles & departments
6. **Lab Bookings** (433KB) - Room reservations with attendance tracking
7. **Library Checkouts** (308KB) - Book borrowing history
8. **WiFi Association Logs** (328KB) - Device network connections
9. **Free Text Notes** (541KB) - Helpdesk tickets, RSVPs, maintenance requests

### Key Relationships
- **Entity IDs**: E100000-E106xxx (link users across all systems)
- **Face IDs**: F100000+ (connect CCTV, embeddings, images)
- **Card IDs**: C1000+ (link physical access to profiles)
- **Device Hashes**: DH... (connect WiFi logs to profiles)
- **Locations**: LAB_101, LIB_ENT, GYM, AUDITORIUM, CAF_01, HOSTEL_GATE, etc.

## 🏆 Core Objectives & Scoring

### 1. Entity Resolution (25% - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Target**: Link entities across datasets using multiple identifiers
- Handle name variants, student_id, email, card_id, device_hash, face_id
- Implement fuzzy string matching + graph-based clustering
- Achieve >90% accuracy for winning

### 2. Cross-Source Linking & Multi-Modal Fusion (25% - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Target**: Connect records across structured data, text, images
- Time-window correlation (events within 5-10 minutes)
- Location-based linking (same location across systems)
- Confidence scores and provenance tracking

### 3. Timeline Generation & Summarization (20% - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Target**: Chronological activity reconstruction
- Smart timeline merging with conflict resolution
- Human-readable summaries with natural language generation
- Interactive timeline visualization

### 4. Predictive Monitoring & Explainability (15% - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Target**: ML inference for missing data with explanations
- Predict likely state/location when data missing
- Evidence-based reasoning (last seen access point, swipe sequence)
- Explainable AI components

### 5. Security Dashboard & UX (10% - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Target**: Dropdown-based interface for security teams
- Asset type queries, ID/name search, time-based filtering
- 12-hour absence alerts
- Real-time monitoring capabilities

### 6. Robustness & Privacy (5% - LOW PRIORITY)
**Target**: Handle noisy data and privacy safeguards
- Partial identifier handling
- Data anonymization and audit trails
- Failure mode analysis
